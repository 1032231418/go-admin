# Contributing

If you want to contribute, but not sure what to do, here's a list of things that I always need help with:

* Translations
    * README.md
    * [docs](https://github.com/GoAdminGroup/docs)
* Bug-hunting
* Finding security problems
* Themes and Plugins

See [manual](https://github.com/GoAdminGroup/go-admin/projects/3) for more information.

You can view all open issues on github, which is usually a good starting point if you want to start contributing:

# Support

You can also donate or become a patreon, which helps out covering server costs and potentially make it possible to put out bounties:

* **Support on [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/go-admin)**
* Donate via [PayPal](https://paypal.me/cg80333)
